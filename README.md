Replace your mouse or trackpad input with keyboard, never take your hands off the keyboard again!


--- HOW TO USE ---
Run it, when prompted, you should give it accissibility permissions on the mac preferences panel, otherwise it will not work - because it needs the MAC OS to give it the right to low-level intercept keystrokes and inject mouse actions!


THE KEYS

Hold down the D-key - yes the letter D, then press H,J,K,L while holding down the D-key to move the mouse around.

Click with V, while holding D.

With practice you can even do mouse-drags, by doing movements while holding the V.

Click F to switch between FAST and SLOW mouse move speeds.



CAN THIS EVEN BE USED ?
---- CODING IT, IMPROVING IT, MAKING CHANGES TO THE CODE ----

This software is extremely BETA.

It may or may not work for you. 
It was written by a complete idiot (me!) who knows nothing about the right way to code on Mac, knows nothing about low level driver coding - I don't even know objective-C language or how to use XCode properly - so it is miracly this works AT ALL.

Just open the project with XCode, and build it. Hope it works for you.
